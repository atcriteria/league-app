# league-app

Taking a short break from League so this application is going on the backburner while I continue work on my RPG Simulator application!

## About

This application is a for-fun app that tracks my main selection of champions and gives the users some information regarding the specific champions as well as some subjective metrics outlining my skill expression with them. The application itself will be a Single-Page-Application created with React and the League of Legends content API.

## Goals

My goals with this application are to be more focused around good responsive design rather than technical capability. In other words, it will be rather simplistic in nature with the main focus being around visual appeal.

I would like to implement a filtering system to sort champions by the role that I play them in, which will likely be the extent of the JavaScript used in this project.
